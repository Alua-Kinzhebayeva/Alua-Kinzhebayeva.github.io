        <title>Hebrew patch</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a dream. I was doing some paperwork when I got a call from our front-end guy saying that my banking API is broken when accessed with Hebrew endpoints (literally -&amp;gt; domain-name-in-hebrew.com/resource-in-hebrew?param-in-hebrew). I thought for a second, shrugged and said &amp;quot;Ah, yeah, there is a Serverless Hebrew patch (plugin) for that. I will deploy a new build with it.&amp;quot;
Ever since, when I find a rock solid solution for some tough case, I exhale with relief &amp;quot;Aha, there is a Hebrew patch for this&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. When you build API and rapidly evolve, this is the least weirdest dream you can end up with.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nox - Google Chrome plugin</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t want to state the obvious, but Internet can be overwhelming like a DDOS attack on your brain.
As for me, on this occasions, I want to buy one-way ticket to nowhere for the content I don&amp;#39;t need, leaving only a couple of sentences I am interested in.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Alua-Kinzhebayeva/nox&quot;&gt;Nox&lt;/a&gt; is a tiny Google Chrome plugin that hides distracting content leaving only important one for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nox in action
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/nox/nox-in-action.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
It is not officially published yet, but can be downloaded and installed from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Alua-Kinzhebayeva/nox&quot;&gt;its Github repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Value Exchange - culture of sharing</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.valexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Value Exchange&lt;/a&gt; - an online service that lets you easily post things you no longer need, but interesting for someone else.
Imagine you are relocating when you realise that you have things you no longer need, and it is time you let them go. All you need to do is to publish an item in two very short steps.
Or a reverse situation, you need a cat carrier. You could save some money by checking Value Exchange in case someone around you is sharing it. In addition to making more room for new things in your life, it is a great opportunity to help someone like you.
Lets build culture of sharing together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Sharing item&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upload image of the item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/value-exchange/upload-image.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Fill in details like name, description and approximate address if you wish to hide your location.
If you wish, you can specify quantity or amount of people who can request the item, so you could choose a person from a pool of requesters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/value-exchange/details.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
In your user profile, once you get requests, go ahead - pick a person and send reply message
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/value-exchange/selecting-requester.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/value-exchange/reply.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
You are all set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Requesting item&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click “request” button on item of interest. All you need now is to wait for the owner to reply.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/value-exchange/request-item.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
When the owner replies, you will see something similar to this in your user profile.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/value-exchange/response.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Once you get requested item physically, don’t forget to thank previous owner by clicking “Thank for the item”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Value Exchange is still in MVP stage, so for better experience use Google Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
