        <title>Love letter to my team</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are one of the most intelligent, kind, open minded people I have and will ever meet in my life.
I equally respect and like every single one of you. Dmitriy, you have my sincerest gratitude for speaking to me in the language of logic. It is my favourite and primary language. I think highly of those speaking or capable of speaking this language. David or just Senior David, there are no words to describe how much I like you and respect you. You are so amazing and so normal that I don’t have to engage my brain (I hate using my brain when not developing software) when being around or talking to you. Going with you to the Serverless conf was one of memorable events in my life, a shared adventure with other First Officer (as in aviation) and Architect, what can be better!  My mind is in love with your mind, neardly speaking. Don Carlos, Lord Protector of Malaga and ruler of Cuba, every time I talk to you my scale for respect gets broken and just for you I need to scale the scales. That is how much I respect you as human being, software developer and a family man. You are making this world better by simply waking up in the morning. My the most favourite memory is going to be us talking on the bus about Software Development or listening to your Cuban stories. This is the only time when I was fully present and not traveling in time. Marija, the Shopify Queen, your adventures stories in quite and melodic voice in the morning are the best start of the day! They literally make my mongolian eyes go wide open (even though it might be hard to spot due to certain reasons :D). It is so amazing how you navigate through you adventures with style and grace! My adventures, for example, sometimes remind me of Game of Thrones, where I fight legal battles, get blood in my eyes and so on, not graceful at all, just adventurous. SSA Rocio, the MONEI master, you are the backbone and soul of our team and the company. I really hope you know that. Without you everything will go down in flames. You are a pride of Andalusia! Ivana, CMO, the Marketing Queen, why on Earth we waisted so much time and didn’t compete in MK until last night?! It is another my most favourite moment next to Cuban stories on the bus. I have lots of nice things to tell about you, but you already know them! The thing I like about you is your backbone! One hell of a backbone. Alfonso, our hasidic and nordic Mexican, kung fu master, I absolutely love your sense of humour, your profound beard and wisdom!  God, I loved discussing where is North and where is South in our versions of universe. That was a hilarious bit! Can’t wait to get my hands on BBC license and spoil accidentally Sherlock or DW, just kidding, you know spoiling Sherlock was a pure accident :D ! Milan, oooof, what a man, a healthy man. When you and my Java dev crush smile at each other, I feel super mega jealous, and the worst part, I don’t even know of whom I am jealous of. Captain Aneta, can’t wait to see you taking off. You, girl, make them (whoever they are) behave! A team is never complete until it has a full time Polish alchemist with almond milk! Enrique, there are very few people in Costa Del Sol who make me smile with my heart, and you are one of them! Your rare visits to office were like holidays to me! It’s been an honor to meet one of the greatest minds of Spain!!! Alua, you are a titan, but you already know that. I, indeed, know that. Now, all nice people and just strangers, please, please, look away, don’t scroll down, don’t read one vile message for a vile person below. It is not for your eyes and your beautiful minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not deserve this team. You are not worth of their spit. Next time, you decide to scream at them, manipulate, screw over with payment for an app(that was or is used in production), consider disinfecting your mind and mouth with carbolic.
The fact you had difficult childhood or may be some biological deviations in your brain, do not give you right to do what you usually do. In your own words “FULL STOP”.  When I said you weren’t superficial, I made a grieve mistake. I couldn’t imagine that you would put your sick games over customers. You are better off doing your beloved FBA, not screwing customers transitively while screwing over your team. Fooling your team about PCI, security, harvest their passwords and insist using a database that doesn’t encrypt data. A nerdgasm for security researchers. You might fool people, but you can’t fool software.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hebrew patch</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a dream. I was doing some paperwork when I got a call from our front-end guy saying that my banking API is broken when accessed with Hebrew endpoints (literally -&amp;gt; domain-name-in-hebrew.com/resource-in-hebrew?param-in-hebrew). I thought for a second, shrugged and said &amp;quot;Ah, yeah, there is a Serverless Hebrew patch (plugin) for that. I will deploy a new build with it.&amp;quot;
Ever since, when I find a rock solid solution for some tough case, I exhale with relief &amp;quot;Aha, there is a Hebrew patch for this&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. When you build API and rapidly evolve, this is the least weirdest dream you can end up with.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nox - Google Chrome plugin</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t want to state the obvious, but Internet can be overwhelming like a DDOS attack on your brain.
As for me, on this occasions, I want to buy one-way ticket to nowhere for the content I don&amp;#39;t need, leaving only a couple of sentences I am interested in.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Alua-Kinzhebayeva/nox&quot;&gt;Nox&lt;/a&gt; is a tiny Google Chrome plugin that hides distracting content leaving only important one for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nox in action
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/nox/nox-in-action.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

        <title>Value Exchange - culture of sharing</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.valexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Value Exchange&lt;/a&gt; - an online service that lets you easily post things you no longer need, but interesting for someone else.
Imagine you are relocating when you realise that you have things you no longer need, and it is time you let them go. All you need to do is to publish an item in two very short steps.
Or a reverse situation, you need a cat carrier. You could save some money by checking Value Exchange in case someone around you is sharing it. In addition to making more room for new things in your life, it is a great opportunity to help someone like you.
Lets build culture of sharing together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Sharing item&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upload image of the item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/value-exchange/upload-image.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Fill in details like name, description and approximate address if you wish to hide your location.
If you wish, you can specify quantity or amount of people who can request the item, so you could choose a person from a pool of requesters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/value-exchange/details.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
In your user profile, once you get requests, go ahead - pick a person and send reply message
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/value-exchange/selecting-requester.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/value-exchange/reply.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
You are all set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Requesting item&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click “request” button on item of interest. All you need now is to wait for the owner to reply.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/value-exchange/request-item.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
When the owner replies, you will see something similar to this in your user profile.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/value-exchange/response.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Once you get requested item physically, don’t forget to thank previous owner by clicking “Thank for the item”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Value Exchange is still in MVP stage, so for better experience use Google Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
