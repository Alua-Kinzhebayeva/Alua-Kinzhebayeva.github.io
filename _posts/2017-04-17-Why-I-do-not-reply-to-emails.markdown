>To be fair to myself, I don't do this all the time :D If I have an answer to email, I reply fast(ish).
####No answer to a technical OS question
If I left a question with no answer or follow up answer, it is because I am a full stack developer digging in extraterrestrial tech (platform different to an OS project), and I try to minimize context switch.
####No answer to a project proposal
Oh, people, this is the tough one. I am always interested in projects even if I don't reply to a proposal. A project that satisfies both functional and non-functional requirements is like an oxygen carrying my will to live. Software is my dialogue with World. It is my version of "Hello. Nice to see you! How are you? Best regards, Alua"
So why don't I answer to an email or return a call? Fear of disappointment of universal scale.
A couple of sequential brain fucks make my subconsciousness think sometimes "They are all the same. All they want is to squeeze you dry and screw over." Why would I spend time thinking of best ways to implement a feature and not being able to pay for a small medical bill with money I earned, but never received.
That is why I don't always answer.
