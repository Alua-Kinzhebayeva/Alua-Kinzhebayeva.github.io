>I was doing some paperwork when I got a call from our front-end guy saying that my banking API is broken when accessed with Hebrew endpoints (literally -> domain-name-in-hebrew.com/resource-in-hebrew?param-in-hebrew). I thought for a second, shrugged and said "Ah, yeah, there is a Serverless Hebrew patch (plugin) for that. I will deploy a new build with it."
Ever since, when I find a rock solid solution for some tough case, I exhale with relief "Aha, there is a Hebrew patch for this".
